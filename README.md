# BMS Folder Structure Fixer
As I was extracting a LOT of BMS charts, my file archiver accidentally created duplicate root folders, and as such my BMS player wouldn't recognize the charts. I also found out I was not the first one this happened to, so I wrote this to remedy it. I am rusty at programming, so it ended up being a very inelegant but flashy solution to a very niche problem.
# Usage
Set BMS Folder Path to the directory containing all your chart directories, in my case it was ``C:\BMS files\All difficulty tables``. Then, press fix. After the status indicator says it's gone through all the folders, it's done.
# Warning
Misusing this tool, or using it for anything it wasn't designed for may result in irreversible data loss, as this software moves and deletes folders according to my very niche needs. Be aware that I am not responsible if this happens, as the software is licensed under the GPLv3.
